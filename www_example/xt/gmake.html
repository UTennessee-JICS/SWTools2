<h1>GNU make</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Tools

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>GNU make is an open-source tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.</p>

<p>Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program. <br/>
  Full documentation for GNU make is found in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual">Make manual</a>.</p>
