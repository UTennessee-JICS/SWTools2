<h1>CPMD</h1>

<p> Category: Science Apps-Molecular Dynamics

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> The CPMD code is a plane wave/pseudopotential implementation of Density Functional Theory, particularly designed for ab-initio molecular dynamics. Its first
version was developed by Jurg Hutter at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory starting from the original Car-Parrinello codes. During the years many people from diverse
organizations contributed to the development of the code and of its pseudopotential library:

 <li> Michele Parrinello, Jurg Hutter, D. Marx, P. Focher, M. Tuckerman, W. Andreoni, A. Curioni, E. Fois, U. Roetlisberger, P. Giannozzi, T. Deutsch, A. Alavi, D.
Sebastiani, A. Laio, J. VandeVondele, A. Seitsonen, S. Billeter and others.

<p> The current version, 3.13, is copyrighted jointly by IBM Corp and by Max Planck Institute, Stuttgart, and is distributed free of charge to non-profit organizations (
see download ). 

<p> CPMD runs on many different computer architectures and it is well parallelized (MPI and Mixed MPI/SMP).

<p>CPMD main characteristics
<ul>
<li>works with norm conserving or ultrasoft pseudopotentials
<li>LDA, LSD and the most popular gradient correction schemes; free energy density functional implementation
<li>isolated systems and system with periodic boundary conditions; k-points
<li>molecular and crystal symmetry
<li>wavefunction optimization: direct minimization and diagonalization
<li>geometry optimization: local optimization and simulated annealing
<li>molecular dynamics: constant energy, constant temperature and constant pressure
<li>path integral MD
<li>response functions
<li>excited states
<li>many electronic properties
<li>time-dependent DFT (excitations, molecular dynamics in excited states)
<li>coarse-grained non-Markovian metadynamics
</ul>

This is a license and not a sale. The Program copyright continues to be owned by International Business Machines Corporation U.S. and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Festkorperforschung, Stuttgart, Germany. Your rights to use the Program are specified in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of IBM's rights under U.S. or international copyright law or any other law.
The authors of the Program include Professor Michele Parrinello.
The Program has not undergone complete testing and may contain errors. It may not function properly and is subject to change or withdrawal at any time. No support or maintenance is provided with the Program. 
The Program is made available without charge in the experimental stage in order to allow you to evaluate the Program in its developmental stage. IBM encourages your feedback and suggestions. 
 
1. Definitions 
The term "Program" means the Car Parrinello Molecular Dynamics Version 3.13 program furnished to you by IBM under this Agreement, and all whole or partial copies of it, in source and/or object code form. A program consists of machine-readable instructions, its components, data, audiovisual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and any related documentation.
The term "Feedback" means Improvements and any ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, and data pertaining to the Program and Improvements disclosed by you to IBM. 
The term "Improvements" means any literary works or other works of authorship in any form (such as programs, program listings, programming tools, documentation, reports, drawings, test scenarios, and results) which are created by you and which are derivative works of the Program.
The term "Early Release" means that the Program is not formally released or generally available. The term does not imply that the Program will be formally released or made generally available. IBM does not guarantee that any program formally released or made generally available will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release versions.
