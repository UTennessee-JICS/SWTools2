<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href=http://eslab.ucdavis.edu/software/qbox/index.htm>Qbox</a> 
is a C++/MPI scalable parallel implementation of first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) based on the plane-wave, pseudopotential formalism. Qbox is designed for operation on large parallel computers.

<p>
The <a href=http://eslab.ucdavis.edu/software/qbox/QboxUserGuide.pdf>Qbox 
User Guide</a> describes the main features of the code. 

<p>
A forum dedicated to questions regarding Qbox installation and use is 
available at <a href=http://fpmd.ucdavis.edu/qbox-list>QBox forum</a>.

 
<h2>Use</h2>

<p> Load the qbox module and run the code in a batch job (on lustre).

<pre>
cd /lustre/scratch/$USER
module avail qbox
module load qbox
aprun -n number_of_tasks $QBOX input_file > output_file
</pre>

The input file contains a list of commands that are read and executed by 
Qbox. The output file created by Qbox is a valid and well formed XML 
document. It can be used to extract various diagnostic
information after the run is completed. During a Qbox run, the output 
file can be used to track the progress of the simulation.

<p>If you want to use the interactive ability of qbox, make sure 
you are running an interactive batch job in /lustre and then just again
type "aprun -n 1 qb" or "aprun -n 1 $QBOX".
