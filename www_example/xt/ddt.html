<h1>DDT</h1>

<p> Category: Tools-Debugger

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
The Distributed Debugging Tool (DDT) is an intuitive, scalable, graphical
debugger. 
DDT can be used as a single-process or a multi-process program (MPI)
debugger. The availability of these capabilities will depend on the licence
that you have - although multi-process licences are always capable of
supporting single-process debugging.

<p> Both modes of DDT are capable of debugging multiple threads, including
OpenMP codes. DDT provides all the standard debugging features (stack trace,
breakpoints, watches, view variables, threads etc.) for every thread running as
part of your program, or for every process - even if these processes are
distributed across a cluster using an MPI implementation.

<p> C, C++, Fortran and Fortran 90/95/2003 are all supported by DDT, along with
a large number of platforms, compilers and all known MPI libraries.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> 
DDT is currently only available on a trial basis until mid Sep 09.  
If you would like
this on a permanent basis, please let NICS know at "help at teragrid.org".

<p><b>First time users:</b>  Note that the first time you use DDT, 
there will need to be some configuration.  A site-wide configuration
has been done for most settings.  But you will need to change a few 
settings (like PBS account and number of processes/threads to debug.)

<p>When compiling the program that you wish to debug, you must add the debug
flag to your compile command. For the most compilers this is -g. It is also
advisable to turn off compiler optimisations as these can make debugging appear
strange and unpredictable. If your program is already compiled without debug
information you will need to remake the files that you are interested in again.

<p>
You can either use it in an interactive batch job or have DDT submit a 
batch job for you.  In the latter case, it does MPI only with 1 process 
per core.
