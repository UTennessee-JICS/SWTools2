<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<A HREF="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK (PARPACK)</A> is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve large scale eigenvalue
problems. 
<p>

The package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a general
n by n matrix A. It is most appropriate for large sparse or structured matrices A where structured
means that a matrix-vector product w <- Av requires order n rather than the usual order n<sup>2</sup>
floating point operations. This software is based upon an algorithmic variant of the Arnoldi process
called the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM). When the matrix A is symmetric it reduces
to a variant of the Lanczos process called the Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Method (IRLM). These
variants may be viewed as a synthesis of the Arnoldi/Lanczos process with the Implicitly Shifted
QR technique that is suitable for large scale problems. For many standard problems, a matrix
factorization is not required. Only the action of the matrix on a vector is needed. 

<p>
ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric, nonsymmetric, and generalized
eigenproblems from significant application areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k)
eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest real part or largest magnitude.
Storage requirements are on the order of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of
Schur basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed which is numerically
orthogonal to working precision. Numerically accurate eigenvectors are available on request.

<h3>Important Features: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Reverse Communication Interface. 
<li> Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric,
<li> Standard or Generalized Problems. 
<li> Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or Generalized
Problems. 
<li> Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems. 
<li> Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition. 
<li> Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement numerous Shift-Invert

<li> strategies for all problem types, data types and precision. 
</ul>

<p>
A parallel version of the ARPACK library, PARPACK,  is also availible. The message passing layers
currently supported are 
<A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/blacs/">BLACS</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/mpi/">MPI </A>. 
Parallel ARPACK (PARPACK) is provided as an extension to the current ARPACK library
(Release 2.1).

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> 
To use the serial version of ARPACK:
<pre>
module load arpack
ftn test.f90 -larpack"
</pre>
or
to use the parallel version of ARPACK (PARPACK):
<pre>
module load arpack
ftn test.f90 -lparpack"
</pre>
<p>
The arpack module must be reloaded if you change the PrgEnv or you must issue a 'module update' command.
