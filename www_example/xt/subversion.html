<h1>Subversion</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Revision Control

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Subversion is a version control system designed as a replacement for CVS.  For more information on subversion, see the 
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">official page</a> or view the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">Subversion Book</a>.  
When using Subversion, you check out a 'working copy' from a repository and edit the working copy.  These changes are saved to 
the repository when a 'commit' operation is run (see below).


<h2>Use</h2>

<p> To use subversion, one must first load the subversion module.

<pre>
  module avail subversion
  module load subversion
</pre>

<p> Subversion contains several major commands.  They include:<br />
<pre>
svn - The main command line client<br />
svnadmin - Create and maintain repositories<br />
svnlook - Diagnostic tool to examine (but not change) attributes of a repository<br />
svnsync - Remote repository mirroring tool
</pre>
</p>


<p> The most commonly used command is 'svn'.  It supports several subcommands.  These are fully documented in the Subversion Book 
(URL is above), but several commonly used subcommands are:<br />
<pre>
svn add - Specifies files to be added to the repository (but doesn't actually add them)
svn checkout - Checks out a working copy from the repository
svn commit - Actually send changes to the repository (changed files, added files, deleted files, etc.)
svn delete - Deletes items from the local working copy or from the repository
svn diff - Perform a 'diff' operation between the repository version and the working copy of a file
svn log - Shows log messages
svn revert - Undo any changes to the local copy and/or undo scheduling operation (svn add, svn delete).  Changes cannot be undone after they are committed.
svn status - Show the status of the working copy (including modified files, files to be added, etc.)
</pre>
