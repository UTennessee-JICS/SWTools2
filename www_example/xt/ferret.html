<p><b>Known Issues:</b>
<ul>
<li> This version of Ferret is statically linked and thus does not support loadable external functions.
<li> The <b>-gui</b> option does not render correctly and may freeze your environment.
<li> You may experience an X-Window problem where it does not like your DISPLAY setting.  Take the number ## in your DISPLAY setting hopefully inherited from X-forwarding which should look like "localhost:##.0" and then set DISPLAY to 127.0.0.1:##.0.
</ul>
