<h1>lgdb</h1>

<p> Category: Tools-Debugger

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
lgdb is used to launch your application and gdbserver processes on remote
nodes for debugging purposes. In order for gdb to be able to stop the
application before being executed aprun must encounter a barrier that gdb will
breakpoint on. Simple command programs such as ls that will not trigger aprun
to trigger this breakpoint are not supported.  Additionally lgdb can be used to
attach to an already running application by supplying the PID of the aprun
process that launched the application.  When running lgdb the present working
directory should be accessible by a remote node (nid).

<p>
lgdb is used to launch an application. After lgdb is run it will give
directions on how to run gdb and attach to processes. The gdb that ships
with lgdb should always be used over any other version.


<h2>Use</h2>
