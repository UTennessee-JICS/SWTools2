<h1>FASTMV</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-Math

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
Fast_mv is a library of high-performance math intrinsic functions. The
library functions can be used in PGI and PathScale programs. You can
use these functions without changing your programs, or you can call
them directly.

<p>The library contains:
<ul>
<li>  exp(), the 64-bit exponential function (the constant e raised to a power)
<li>  expf(), the 32-bit exponential function (the constant e raised to a power)
<li>  frda_exp(), the 64-bit exponential function for all elements in an array
<li>  frsa_expf(), the 32-bit exponential function for all elements in an array
<li>  cos(), the 64-bit cosine function
<li>  sin(), the 64-bit sine function
<li>  sincos(), the 64-bit sine and cosine function
<li>  log(), the 64-bit logarithm (base e) function
<li>  logf(), the 32-bit logarithm (base e) function
<li>  frda_log(), the 64-bit logarithm (base e) function for all elements
        in an array
</ul>


<h2>Use</h2>

<p> 
To use Fast_mv functions, first load the libfast module:
<pre>
    % module load libfast
</pre>
After loading the module, you can do a man of "intro_fast_mv" or "cos" 
for more information including "cautions" and "examples".

<p>
Then include -lfast_mv on the compiler command line:
<pre>
    % ftn -o program program.f90 -lfast_mv
    % cc -o program program.c -lfast_mv
</pre>

Note:  If you include -l options for other math libraries on the
link command, the -lfast_mv argument must come first.

<p>   The library also has array versions of some functions. Array versions
compute the function for all elements of an argument array and store
the results in a second array. Array functions are usually the fastest
way to compute a function when it must be performed many times.
