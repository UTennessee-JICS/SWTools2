<h1>SWIG</h1>

<p> Category:  Program Dev-Languages

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written
 in C and C++ with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby,
 and Tcl. It works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header
 files and using them to generate the wrapper code that scripting 
 languages need to access the underlying C/C++ code. 
 In addition, SWIG provides a variety of customization features that 
 let you tailor the wrapping process to suit your application.
