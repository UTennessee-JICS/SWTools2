<h2>Description</h2>

<p> <a href="http://mpip.sourceforge.net/">mpiP</a> 
is a lightweight profiling library for MPI applications.
Because it only collects statistical information about MPI functions,
mpiP generates considerably less overhead and much less data than
tracing tools. All the information captured by mpiP is task-local. It
only uses communication during report generation, typically at the end
of the experiment, to merge results from all of the tasks into one
output file.

<p>mpiP has been tested on a variety of C/C++/Fortran applications from 2
to 4096 processes, including a 3584-process run on ASCI Q and a
4096-process run on ASCI White. 


<h2>Use</h2>

<p> mpiP is available via the standard module commands.


<pre>
  module avail mpip
  module load mpip/3.1.2
  cc test.c ${MPIP_LIB}
</pre>
