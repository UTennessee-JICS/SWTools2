<h1>VIM</h1>

<p>Category: Program Dev-Editor

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

<p>Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though.  Vim is good for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>VIM is available both from /usr/bin and as a module.  The
/usr/bin executable is older (6.2) with no gui support.  New versions
are available as modules with gui support.

  module load vim/7.1
  vim test.f
</pre>
