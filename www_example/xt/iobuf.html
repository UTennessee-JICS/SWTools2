<h1>IOBUF</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-IO

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
     IOBUF is an I/O buffering library that can reduce the I/O wait time
     for programs that read or write large files sequentially. IOBUF
     intercepts standard I/O calls such as read and open and replaces the
     stdio (glibc, libio) layer of buffering with an additional layer of
     buffering, thus improving program performance by enabling asynchronous
     prefetching and caching of file data.

<p>
     IOBUF can also gather runtime statistics and print a summary report of
     I/O activity for each file.

<p> NOTE:  This is beta software for CLE.  IOBUF has been available
    on XT systems running Catamount, but not on systems running compute
    node linux.


<h2>Use</h2>
<p>
     In general, no program source changes are needed in order to take
     advantage of IOBUF. Instead, IOBUF is implemented by following these
     steps:
<ol>
 <li> Load the IOBUF module:
      <pre>
        % module load iobuf
      </pre>
 <li> Relink the program.

 <li> Set the IOBUF_PARAMS environment variable as needed.
</ol>


<p> 
<pre>
module avail iobuf
module load iobuf
ftn test.f   OR   cc test.c   # automatically links in iobuf-cnl.o
</pre>
