<h1>BLACS</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-Communication

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> The BLACS (Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms) is a linear algebra oriented message passing interface.  Cray provides this as part of Libsci, and will be automatically linked against when using the Cray wrappers cc, CC, and ftn.

The length of time required to implement efficient distributed memory algorithms makes it impractical to rewrite programs for every new parallel machine. The BLACS exist in order to make linear algebra applications both easier to program and more portable. It is for this reason that the BLACS are used as the communication layer of ScaLAPACK.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> One only has to use the Cray wrapper scripts (cc, CC, and ftn) to
automatically link against the BLACS (which is contained in libsci.)

<h2>Support</h2><p>This package has the following support level : Supported
