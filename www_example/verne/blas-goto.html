<h1>BLAS-GOTO</h1>

<p> Category:  Libraries-Math

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

This particular implementation is called the 'Goto BLAS', named after the developer,
Kazushige Goto of the Texas Advanced Computing Center. 


<h2>Use</h2>
This BLAS implementation is available as a module.
