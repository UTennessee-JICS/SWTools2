<h1>ACML</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-Math

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> The AMD Core Math Library (ACML) is a set of numerical routines
tuned specifically for AMD64 platform processors (including OpteronTM
and AthlonTM64 ). The routines, which are available via both FORTRAN
77 and C interfaces, include:

<ul>
 <li>
 BLAS - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (including Sparse Level 1
BLAS);
 <li>
 LAPACK - A comprehensive package of higher level linear algebra
routines;
 <li>
 FFT - a set of Fast Fourier Transform routines for real and complex
data;
 <li>
 RNG - a set of random number generators and statistical distribution
functions.
</ul>

<p>The BLAS and LAPACK routines provide a portable and standard set of
interfaces for common numerical linear algebra operations that allow
code containing calls to these routines to be readily ported across
platforms. Full documentation for the BLAS and LAPACK are available
online. 

<p>The FFT is an implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT) that makes use of symmetries in the definition to reduce the
number of operations required from O(n*n) to O(n*log n) when the
sequence length, n, is the product of small prime factors; in
particular, when n is a power of 2. Despite the popularity and
widespread use of FFT algorithms, the definition of the DFT is not
sufficiently precise to prescribe either the forward and backward
directions (these are sometimes interchanged), or the scaling factor
associated with the forward and backward transforms (the combined
forward and backward transforms may only reproduce the original
sequence by following a prescribed scaling).

<p>Currently, there is no agreed standard API for FFT routines. Hardware
vendors usually provide a set of high performance FFTs optimized for
their systems: no two vendors employ the same interfaces for their FFT
routines. The ACML provides a set of FFT routines, optimized for AMD64
processors, using an ACML-specific set of interfaces. 

<p>The RNG is a comprehensive set of statistical distribution
functions which are founded on various underlying uniform distribution
generators (base generators) including Wichmann- Hill and an
implementation of the Mersenne Twister. In addition there are hooks
which allow you to supply your own preferred base generator if it is
not already included in ACML. 

<p> A supplementary library of fast math and fast vector math
functions (ACML MV) is also provided with some 64-bit versions of
ACML. Some of the functions included in ACML MV are not callable from
high-level languages, but must be called via assembly language.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> The acml module must be loaded first.
<pre>
  module avail acml
  module load acml
</pre>
Note that the module will set the environment variables based on what 
compiler you
have loaded as a module.  If you have multiple compiler modules
loaded before loading acml, the environment variables will point to
one of the loaded compilers, not more.

<p> ACML_DIR points to the installation directory.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Fortran: 
<pre>
  serial use
     pgf90/pathf90/gfortran test.f90 ${ACML_LIB}

  multi-core/threaded use:
     pgf90/pathf90/gfortran -mp test.f90 ${ACML_MPLIB}
</pre>
You will probably need to use "-fPIC" or "static" options to make the linking
step work.

<p>
C:
<pre>
  serial use
     pgcc/pathcc/gcc test.f90 ${ACML_LIB} -lpgf90libs/pathfortran/gfortran

  multi-core/threaded use:
     pgcc/pathcc/gcc -mp test.f90 ${ACML_MPLIB} -lpgf90libs/pathfortran/gfortran
</pre>
