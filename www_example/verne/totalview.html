<p> Category: Tools-Debugger

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The TotalView debugger is a tool that lets you debug, analyze, and tune the performance of complex serial, multiprocessor, and multithreaded programs.  It can be executed either as a GUI (by using the <code>totalview</code> executable) or from a command-line interface (by using the <code>totalviewcli</code> executable).</p>

<p>Since the TotalView GUI is an X-Window application, your system must be set up to allow and run X11 traffic.  It is best to tunnel the X11 traffic through the SSH connection.  To do this, your SSH connection needs to allow X11 forwarding.  This can be accomplished by adding the line <code>ForwardX11 yes</code> to your SSH config file or by using the <code>-X</code> option to SSH.


<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Load an appropriate TotalView module.  For example,
<pre>module load totalview/8.4.0-0</pre></p>

<p>TotalView can be used in a number of ways.  To debug an existing core file (and not a currently running parallel process), you can launch TotalView with the command:
<pre>totalview a.out core</pre></p>

<p>If you want to use TotalView to start your job and monitor it as it runs, you must take some additional steps. Because parallel jobs cannot be launched directly from the login nodes, you will need to launch TotalView from within a batch job. The easiest way to do this is to start an interactive batch job as follows:
<pre>qsub -I -lnodes=8:ppn=4,walltime=1:00:00 -A ABC123 -X -qdebug</pre>
The <code>-X</code> option is required, as it tells PBS to forward any X11 traffic from the compute nodes back to the login node.  The X11 traffic will then be forwarded from the login node across your ssh connection to your workstation.</p>

<p>Once your job starts, you can launch TotalView from the command line.  The following example starts TotalView on 32 compute cores:
<pre>totalview mpirun -a -np 32 ./a.out</pre></p>
