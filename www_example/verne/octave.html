<h1>Octave</h1>

<p> Category: Analysis-Mathematics

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line
interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and
for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is
mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented
language.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> Octave was built with the default gcc to include hdf5.  
So the PGI and Pathscale compilers need to be unloaded before 
hdf5/1.6.7 is loaded, and then the octave module can be loaded.

<pre>
  module unload PE-pgi PE-pathscale
  module load hdf5/1.6.7
  module load octave/3.0.1
  octave
</pre>
