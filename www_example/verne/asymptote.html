<h1>Asymptote</h1>

<p> Category: Analysis-Visualization

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/">Asymptote</a> 
is a powerful script-based vector graphics language that
provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing. 
Asymptote has labels and equations that are typeset with LaTeX, for
high-quality PostScript output.

<p>A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it
is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program: it
can therefore exploit the best features of script (command-driven) and
graphical user interface (GUI) methods.
