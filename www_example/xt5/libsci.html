<h1>LibSci</h1>

<p> Category: Libraries-Math

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Cray XT-LibSci is a collection of single-processor and parallel
numerical routines tuned for performance on Cray XT series systems.
Cray XT-LibSci is included in the Cray XT programming environment.
Generally speaking, it is suggested that users of the Cray XT systems
call LibSci routines in your application instead of public domain or user-written versions.

<p>LibSci is provided with the Cray Programming Environment and is
automatically loaded with the PrgEnv module. LibSci provides Fortran
interfaces for all routines and support for 32- and 64-bit data
types.

<P> LibSci contains single-processor support for:
<ul>
 <li> FFT (Fast Fourier transform, convolution and filtering)
 <li> BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines).  This is based on the
libGoto library from the University of Texas.
 <li> LAPACK (Linear Algebra routines)
 <li> IRT (Iterative Refinement Toolkit)
 <li> SuperLU_dist (sparse solvers).  Only the distributed-memory parallel
version of SuperLU is provided.   If you need the serial SUPERLU
version, Cray provides that in the PETSc module.
</ul>

<P> LibSci contains multiprocessor support in a distributed memory
environment for:
<ul>
 <li> FFT (Fast Fourier transform, convolution and filtering)
 <li> ScaLAPACK (parallel Linear Algebra routines)
 <li> BLACS (Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms)
 <li> SuperLU_dist (sparse solvers).  Only the distributed-memory parallel
version of SuperLU is provided. If you need the serial SUPERLU version, 
Cray provides that in the PETSc module.
</ul>

<p> Cray XT-LibSci also contains the Iterative Refinement Toolkit (IRT), which is a library of solvers and tools that provides solutions to linear systems using single-precision factorizations while preserving accuracy through mixed-precision iterative refinement.

<p> There are man pages for intro_blas1, intro_blas2, intro_blas3,
intro_lapack, intro_irt, intro_blacs, intro_scalapack, intro_fft,
and intro_crafft.  (Note some man pages only exist for some libsci
versions.)  And there is the "Cray XT Series Programming Environment
User's Guide" at the <a href="http://docs.cray.com/">Cray Docs</a>
website.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> libsci is automatically linked against by the Cray compiler
wrappers:  cc, CC, and ftn.  

<h2>Revision Information</h2>

<h3>Libsci 10.3.0</h3>
This version contains 
<pre>
      CRAFFT    1.0
      LibGoto   1.26
      ScaLAPACK 1.8
      Bug Fixes
</pre>

<p>CRAFFT (Cray Adaptive FFT) is a new feature in libsci-10.3.0. CRAFFT uses
offline and online testing information to adaptively select the best FFT
algorithm from the available FFT options. CRAFFT provides a very simple
user interface into advanced FFT functionality and performance.  Planning
and execution are combined into one call with CRAFFT. The library comes
packaged with pre-computed plans so that in many cases the planning stage
can be omitted. Please see the manual page intro_crafft for more information.

<P>Usage note : for the most optimal usage of CRAFFT, please copy the file
/opt/xt-libsci/10.3.0/fftw_wisdom into the lustre directory where the
executable is run from. 

<P>LibGoto 1.26 includes enhanced BLAS performance. There are several libsci
library variants installed with the libsci-10.3.0 package. On quadcore
XT4 systems, the xtpe-quadcore module is loaded by default and 
ensures that quadcore-optimized libsci library will be loaded automatically.

<p>To use threaded BLAS, the  thread-enabled libsci library whose name is
suffixed with '_mp' should be linked explicitly
<pre>
   ftn -o myexec -lsci_quadcore_mp
</pre>

<p>Libsci-10.3 and fftw-3.1.1 are now dependent. If you wish to use fftw
version 2.1.5 then do the following

<pre>
module swap fftw/3.1.1 fftw/2.1.5.1
</pre>

<h3>Libsci 10.2.1</h3>

<p>The xt-libsci 10.2.1 release contains new versions of the scientific
libraries for quad-core single thread and quad-core multi-thread.

<p> By default, "module load xt-libsci" results in linking with the
single-core version of the libsci. 

<p>The xtpe-quadcore module is loaded by default.  This is necessary to 
use the quad-core single thread library.
This results in these environment variables being set:
<pre>
   XTPE_QUADCORE_ENABLED        ON
   LIBSCI_PRE_LINK_OPTS         -lsci_quadcore  -lsci_quadcore
   PGI_POST_COMPILE_OPTS        -tp barcelona-64 -tp barcelona-64
   PATHSCALE_POST_COMPILE_OPTS  -march=barcelona -march=barcelona
   GNU_POST_COMPILE_OPTS        -march=barcelona -march=barcelona
   LLVM_AMD_10H                 1
</pre>

<p>For Quad-core multi-thread, the users must explicitly use the
"-lsci_mp" compiler option to point to the correct library.

<p>Use of the quad-core libraries in this package requires the
xtpe-quadcore module which is released in the xt-asyncpe 1.0 (or
later) package.
