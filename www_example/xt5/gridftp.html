<h1>GridFTP</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Tools

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol
optimized for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. It is based upon the Internet
FTP protocol, and it implements extensions for high-performance operation.

<p>
GridFTP uses basic Grid security on both control (command) and data channels.
Other features include multiple data channels for parallel transfers, partial
file transfers, third-party (direct server-to-server) transfers, reusable data
channels, and command pipelining.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> 
To use GridFTP, you must have a "certificate".  We first show how you use
GridFTP assuming you have a certificate.  Then we show how to obtain 
certificates.

<h4>Using Gridftp</h4>
<p>The client that NICS supports for 
<a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.1.1/data/gridftp/globus-url-copy.html">GridFTP
</a> is globus-url-copy.  The URL for the NICS GridFTP is
gridftp.nics.teragrid.org. A listing of other GridFTP servers around the
teragrid can be found 
<a href="http://teragrid.org/userinfo/data/transfer_location.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>For example, to copy everything in Joe's directory on a Lustre file system
to the corresponding directory on the XT5, use the following command:</p>

<pre> % globus-url-copy -r \
    gsiftp://gridftp-co.ncsa.teragrid.org:2811/joe/ \
    gsiftp://gridftp.nics.teragrid.org/lustre/scratch/joe/</pre>

<p>Note that the tailing forward slashes are required for directories.  If the
<code>-r</code> (recursive) is omitted and a directory is being transferred,
the files in that directory will be transferred, but not the files in
subdirectories.</p>

<p>You may also use GridFTP via <code>uberftp</code>, either one-liners or
interactively.  The syntax of <code>uberftp</code> is very similar to
<code>sftp</code>.</p>


<h3>Get a certificate</h3>
<p>Certificates can be handled locally or remotely.  For one-time use, it is
generally easier to use the myproxy server method, however, if you are
routinely signing in from the same computer, it is probably worthwhile to set
up a local grid certificate.</p>

<h4>Using the MyProxy Server ("Remote Method")</h4>
<p>First, make sure the Globus toolkit is in your path (to check, try <code>which myproxy-init</code>).  On Kraken, you must load the Globus module:</p>

<pre>
 kraken> module load globus
</pre>

<p>
Other sites may have it loaded by default, or by a different mechanism.  Now
you can get a proxy certificate from the main myproxy server:</p>

<pre>
 kraken> myproxy-logon [-l <em>TG_Portal_Username</em>]
Enter MyProxy pass phrase: 
A credential has been received for user userjd in /tmp/x509up_u000.
</pre>

<p>By default, <code>myproxy-logon</code> uses your current username.  You must
specify your TeraGrid Portal username if it is different.  For your pass
phrase, enter your TeraGrid Portal password.  This credential is only valid for
12 hours by default, though this may be lowered with the <code>-t</code>
flag.</p>

<h4>Using a Local Grid Certificate ("Local Method")</h4>

<strong>Getting the Grid Certificate: Once a Year</strong>
<p>This method requires that you create a Grid Certificate.  This may be used to create proxy certificates, and is valid for a year.</p><p>

<pre>userjd@local:~> ssh <em>userjd</em>@tg-login.ncsa.teragrid.org
[...]
userjd@ncsa:~> ncsa-cert-request
To continue, please enter the NCSA Kerberos password for userjd: 
For increased security, your NCSA default password is also needed.
To continue, please enter the NCSA default password for userjd: 
[...]
Please enter your private key encryption passphrase: 
Verifying private key passphrase, please reenter passphrase: </pre>

<p>Your "NCSA default password" is as it appears on the password sheet you
received when first receiving a TeraGrid account&mdash;this also had your
initial Portal password.  When you set your "private key encryption
passphrase," note that it must be at least 12 characters.</p><p>

<p>You should now have a <code>.globus</code> folder with your grid
certificate.  You need to put this on the machine you wish to log in from,
Kraken in this instance.  This machine must have Grid capabilities.</p>

<pre>userjd@ncsa:~> scp -r \
~/.globus <em>userjd</em>@kraken-pwd.nics.teragrid.org:~/.globus</pre>

<strong>Creating the Proxy Certificate: Every Time</strong>
<p>Now log in to the machine you wish to log in from.  Make sure the Globus
tools are in the path, and enter the following:</p>

<pre>userjd@some:~> grid-proxy-init
Your identity: [...]
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ............................. Done
Your proxy is valid until: [...]</pre>

<p>Enter the 12+ character passphrase you chose when creating the cert, and you
should be good to connect to TeraGrid sites without further passwords for the
duration of the proxy. </p>

<h3>Using the Globus Utilities</h3>
<h4>Managing Certificates</h4>
<p>Proxy certificates are usually valid for 12 hours.  If you finish early, it
is a good practice to remove the proxy certificate using
<code>grid-proxy-destroy</code>.  To check a proxy certificate, use
<code>grid-proxy-info</code>, or to check a grid certificate, use
<code>grid-cert-info</code>.  In general, <code>myproxy-*</code> commands
communicate with the myproxy server, <code>grid-proxy-*</code> commands deal
with your proxy certificate, and <code>grid-cert-*</code> commands deal with
your local grid certificate. </p>

<h4>GSISSH</h4>
<p>This is OpenSSH, which has been modified to use the security described
above.  If <code>grid-proxy-info</code> shows that you have a proxy, you should
be able to connect to any <code>gsissh</code>-enabled machine.  Note that not
every target supports <code>gsissh</code>: <code>kraken-pwd</code>
(<code>tg-login-pwd</code>) does support it, but <code>kraken</code>,
<code>login</code>, and <code>verne</code> at NICS only accept OTP
authentication.  If GSI authentication fails, <code>gsissh</code> will default
to standard keyboard-interactive.</p> 
<pre>
  ncsa> gsissh kraken-pwd.nics.teragrid.org
</pre>

<p>It is not necessary to specify a username, your proxy identity is
automatically mapped to the username on the machine you are trying to
access.</p>

<h4>Using Gridftp</h4>

<p>You now have the required proxy certificate and can use GridFTP.  The client
that NICS supports for <a
href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.1.1/data/gridftp/globus-url-copy.html">GridFTP
</a> is globus-url-copy.  The URL for the NICS GridFTP is
gridftp.nics.teragrid.org. A listing of other GridFTP servers around the
teragrid can be found <a
href="http://teragrid.org/userinfo/data/transfer_location.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>For example, to copy everything in Joe's directory on a Lustre file system
to the corresponding directory on the XT5, use the following command:</p>

<pre> % globus-url-copy -r \
    gsiftp://gridftp-co.ncsa.teragrid.org:2811/joe/ \
    gsiftp://gridftp.nics.teragrid.org/lustre/scratch/joe/</pre>

<p>Note that the tailing forward slashes are required for directories.  If the
<code>-r</code> (recursive) is omitted and a directory is being transferred,
the files in that directory will be transferred, but not the files in
subdirectories.</p>

<p>You may also use GridFTP via <code>uberftp</code>, either one-liners or
interactively.  The syntax of <code>uberftp</code> is very similar to
<code>sftp</code>.</p>
