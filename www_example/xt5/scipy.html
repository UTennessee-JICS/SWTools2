<h2>Description</h2>

<p> SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
 science, and engineering. It is also the name of a very popular conference
 on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy,
 which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. 
 The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many
 user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give SciPy a try! 


<h2>Use</h2>
SciPy is available as module via Python.
