<h1>UPC</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Compilers

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Cray provides a UPC compiler as one of several programming environments.  The UPC compiler is a translator built with either PGI or GCC.  

<P> XTs have two kinds of nodes, but the UPC compilers only build executables to be run on the compute nodes.  Thus

<ul>
  <li> You should use the Cray wrappers cc, CC, and ftn
  <li> The wrappers will call the appropriate UPC compiler which will use the appropriate header files and link against the appropriate libraries.
</ul>

<p> The Cray wrappers cc, CC, and ftn will automatically link against the appropriate communication libraries and SciLib (-lsci).  See the cc, CC, and ftn man pages for more information on their usage.

<p> To see a man page on the UPC compilers with a full list of compiler options, first make sure either "PrgEnv-upc-pgi" or "PrgEnv-upc-gnu" module is loaded, and then do a man on "upcc".


<h2>Use</h2>

<p>It is best to review the upcc man page.

<p>To use the Cray wrappers to the UPC compilers, then either PrgEnv-upc-pgi or PrgEnv-upc-gnu module should be loaded:

<pre>
  module avail PrgEnv
  module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-upc-gnu        
</pre>

<p> To run the code, the executable must be launched with "upcrun" inside a batch job.
