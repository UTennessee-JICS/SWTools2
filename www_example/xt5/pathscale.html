<h1>Pathscale</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Compilers

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Cray provides the Pathscale compilers as part of several programming environments.  Versions 3.x are available.

<P> XTs have two kinds of nodes:

<ol>
 <li> Compute nodes running the CNL OS.
 <ul>
  <li> To build code for the compute nodes, you should use the Cray wrappers cc, CC, and ftn.
  <li> The wrappers will call the appropriate PGI compiler which will use the appropriate header files and link against the appropriate libraries.
 </ul>
 <li> Service and login nodes running Linux.
 <ul>
  <li> To build code for the Linux service nodes, you can call the Pathscale compilers directly.  (See list below.)
  <li> We strongly suggest that you don't call the Pathscale compilers directly if you are building code to run on the compute nodes.
 </ul>
</ol>

<p> The Cray wrappers cc, CC, and ftn will automatically link against MPI (-lmpi) and SciLib (-lsci).  This is not true when calling the Pathscale compilers directly.  See the cc, CC, and ftn man pages for more information on their usage.

<p> To see man pages on Pathscale compilers with a full list of compiler options, first make sure the "PrgEnv-pathscale" module is loaded, and then do a man on any of the following:
<ul>
 <li> pathcc 
 <li> pathCC 
 <li> pathf90/pathf95
</ul>

<p> For more detailed information, see <a href="http://www.pathscale.com/">Pathscale documentation</a> and <a href="http://docs.cray.com">Cray's documentation</a>.


<h2>Use</h2>

<p>It is best to review the pathcc, pathCC, and pathf95 man pages for a list of their options.  You should also check out the eko
man page, which has the complete list of options for the Pathscale Compiler suite.

<p>To use the Cray wrappers with the Pathscale compilers, the PrgEnv-pathscale module should be loaded:

<pre>
  module avail PrgEnv
  module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-pathscale        # this loads some version of pathscale, currently 3.2
</pre>

To just use the Pathscale compilers directly, just load the pathscale module you want:

<pre>
  module avail pathscale
  module load pathscale/3.2           # Note that this does not changed the Cray wrappers.
</pre>

It is possible to use the Pathscale compiler versions directly without loading the Cray Programming Environments, but note that
the Cray wrappers will probably not work as expected if you do that.

<h3>Enabling Quad-core Instructions</h3>

<p>Note that with CNL 2.0.49 and above, the following options are
set automatically by the xtpe-quadcore module (loaded by default),
which enable quad-core instructions when compiling.  This is actually
quite important to get good performance.
<pre>
jaguar12> module display xtpe-quadcore
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/opt/xt-asyncpe/1.0/modulefiles/xtpe-quadcore:

prepend-path     PE_PRODUCT_LIST XTPE_QUADCORE
setenv           XTPE_QUADCORE_ENABLED ON
setenv           LIBSCI_PRE_LINK_OPTS  -lsci_quadcore
setenv           PGI_POST_COMPILE_OPTS   -tp barcelona-64
setenv           PATHSCALE_POST_COMPILE_OPTS  -march=barcelona
setenv           GNU_POST_COMPILE_OPTS  -march=barcelona
setenv           LLVM_AMD_10H 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p> However, be aware that the "barcelona" option does not work with
older versions of the compiler.

<h3>Underscoring</h3>
<p> The Pathscale Fortran compiler (pathf90) by default adds two underscores 
to the symbol names.  However, the Cray ftn wrapper to pathf90 has 
"-fno-second-underscore" on by default.  So, the default behavior is 
different between pathf90 and ftn (using pathf90).  

<p> It is often the case that applications will have trouble resolving
symbols when using Pathscale compilers because of the 2 underscores.  
It seems that use of -fno-second-underscore often avoids these
problems.  All packages that the NICS has built for the XT5 with pathf90
directly <b>were</b> built with "-fno-second-underscore".
