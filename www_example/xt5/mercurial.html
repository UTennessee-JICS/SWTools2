<p> Category: Program Dev-Revision Control

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Mercurial is a fast and lightweight source control management system 
designed for efficient handling of very large distributed projects. 
Unlike tools such as CVS and Subversion, Mercurial is completely distributed 
and does not possess a centralized client/server architecture.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> To use Mercurial, one must first load the appropriate module:

<pre>
  module avail mercurial
  module load mercurial
</pre>

<p> The unofficial Mercurial manual, 
<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbook.html">Distributed Revision Control 
with Mercurial</a> gives a good description of Mercurial's use.
