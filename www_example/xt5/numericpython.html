<h1>Numeric Python</h1>

<p> Category: Program Dev-Languages-Python

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Numeric (version 24.2)
Numeric was the first arrayobject built for Python.  
It has been quite successful and is used in a wide 
variety of settings and applications.   Maintenance 
has ceased for Numeric, and users should transisition 
to NumPy as quickly as possible.   There is a module 
called numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code1 in NumPy that can
make the transition to NumPy easier (it will automatically 
perform the search-and-replace style changes that need to
be made to python code that uses Numeric to make it work with NumPy). 

<p> NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.

<p> This package contains:
<ul>
<li>a powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
<li>sophisticated (broadcasting) functions </li>
<li>basic linear algebra functions</li>
<li>basic Fourier transforms </li>
<li>sophisticated random number capabilities </li>
<li>tools for integrating Fortran code</li> 
<li>tools for integrating C/C++ code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p> Just like all Python modules and packages, the Numeric module can be invoked using either the import Numeric form, or the from Numeric import ... form.
<pre>
from Numeric import *
</pre>
<pre>
or
import Numeric
</pre>

<p>The Numpy module can be invoked using either the import numpy form, or the from numpy import ... form.: 
<pre>
from numpy import *
</pre>
<pre>
or
import numpy
</pre>
