<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window System, which combines a standard, easy to use, graphical user interface with the thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit text eight hours a day. It provides intensive support for development in a wide variety of languages, text processors, and other tools, but at the same time can be used productively by just about anyone who needs to edit text. NEdit, which is entirely a volunteer effort, benefits from a strong developer and user community. As of version 5.1, NEdit may be freely distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
