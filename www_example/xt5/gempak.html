<h2>Description</h2>

<p> <a href='http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/'>GEMPAK</a>, 
the GEneral Meteorology PAcKage, is an analysis, display, and
product generation package for meteorological data. It is developed by NCEP
(the National Centers for Environmental Prediction) for use by the National
Centers (Storm Prediction Center (SPC), Tropical Prediction Center (TPC),
Aviation Weather Center (AWC), Hydrologic Prediction Center (HPC), Marine
Prediction Center (MPC), Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), etc.) in
producing operational forecast and analysis products such as those distributed
as Redbook Graphics and others displayed on the NWS web pages and utilized
internally within the centers. Graphical User Interfaces provide convenient
access to interactive data manipulation. A comprehensive set of decoders
enables integration of real-time and archive data, products, and bulletins. The
GEMPAK distribution consists of a suite of application programs, Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), meteorologic computation libraries, graphic display
interfaces, and device drivers for the decoding, analysis, display and
diagnosis of geo-referenced and meteorological data.

<p>The Unidata Program Center distributes and provides support for GEMPAK to our
member sites. Membership in Unidata is open to U.S. colleges and universities,
and is free of charge. GEMPAK is also available as unsupported software without
charge to organizations which do not participate in Unidata through the
limitations specified in the Unidata participation policy. The Unidata program
center release of GEMPAK/NAWIPS incorporates several additions developed both
locally and at other locations to enhance the use of real-time data aquired
through the Unidata IDD, and through instructional case studies such as those
developed at COMET.

<p>GEMPAK provides a powerful interactive user environment for research and
education in addition to operational forecasting. Many sites also utilize
GEMPAK's text interface programs for classroom and web product generation as
well as research and operational/real-time displays through scripts and product
generation files. An example of GEMPAK utility within the Unidata community is
the IDD data stream delivering facsimile replacement products (eg, the DIFAX
feed) generated at the University of Wisconsin. GEMPAK is also being used to
generate radar mosaics for the Unidata IDD FNEXRAD data stream by compositing
individual NIDS products into a common projection and data set. These products
are available to Unidata sites both in the form of images, as well as numerical
grids which can be used in diagnostic calculations with other gridded data sets
to produce additional value added data.
